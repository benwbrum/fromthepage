FromThePage is a collaborative transcription platform. That means we collaborate -- work together -- to transcribe interesting historical documents. If someone makes a change to a page you transcribed, please consider it well-intentioned. It's easy to take corrections as criticism, but they probably aren't. Even professional writers have editors that correct their work.

Things to consider:
-- Did I make a mistake? If I did, that's OK -- mistakes are human.
-- Were the changes to my transcription a mistake? If so, the right course of action is to fix the transcription, but not to get upset.
-- In doubt? Review the transcription conventions on the bottom of the page, the help tab, and the example documents. Have a civil conversation in the "notes" on the page. You can also contact the project owner, usually listed on the footer of every page.

Thanks,
FromThePage
