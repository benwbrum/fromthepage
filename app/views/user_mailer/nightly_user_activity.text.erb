Hi <%=@user.display_name%> --

We just wanted to let you know that there's been activity in a collection that you worked on.

<%unless @added_works.blank?%>
  <% @added_works.each do |work|%>
    <%=work.owner.display_name%> added <%=work.title%> to the collection <%=work.collection.title%>.  
    To view <%=work.collection.title%>: <%=work.title%>, visit the following URL: <%=collection_read_work_path(work.collection.owner, work.collection, work, only_path: false)%>
  <%end%>
<%end%>

<%unless @active_pages.blank?%>
  <%@active_pages.each do |page|%>
    Page <%=page.title%> from work <%=page.work.title%> in the collection <%=page.collection.title%> has been edited since you worked on it.
    To view the page <%=page.work.title%>: <%=page.title%>, visit the following URL: <%=collection_transcribe_page_path(page.collection.owner, page.collection, page.work, page, only_path: false)%>
  <%end%>
<%end%>

<%unless @active_note_pages.blank?%>
  <%@active_note_pages.each do |page|%>
    We just wanted to let you know that a note has been added to a page you worked on in work <%=page.work.title%>, in the collection <%=page.collection.title%>.
    To view the note on page <%=page.work.title%>: <%=page.title%>, visit the following URL: <%=collection_transcribe_page_path(page.collection.owner, page.collection, page.work, page, only_path: false)%>
  <%end%>
<%end%>

Thanks,
