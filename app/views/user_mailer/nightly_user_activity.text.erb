Hi <%=@user_activity.user.display_name%> --

We just wanted to let you know that there's been activity in a collection that you worked on.

<% unless @user_activity.added_works.blank? %>
  New Works
  <% @user_activity.added_works.each do |work| %>
    <%=work.owner.display_name%> added <%=work.title%> to the collection <%=work.collection.title%>.
    To view <%=work.collection.title%>: <%=work.title%>, visit the following URL: <%=collection_read_work_url(work.collection.owner, work.collection, work, only_path: false)%>
  <%end%>
<%end%>

<% unless @user_activity.active_note_pages.blank? %>
  New Notes
  <% @user_activity.active_note_pages.each do |page| %>
    A note has been added to a page you worked on in work <%=page.work.title%>, in the collection <%=page.collection.title%>.
    To view the note on page <%=page.work.title%>: <%=page.title%>, visit the following URL: <%=collection_transcribe_page_url(page.collection.owner, page.collection, page.work, page, only_path: false)%>
  <%end%>
<%end%>

Thanks,
