Hi <%=@user.display_name%> --

We just wanted to let you know that the following note has been added to a page you worked on in work <%=@page.work.title%>, in the collection <%=@page.collection.title%>.

"<%=@note.body%>"

You can view the note in <%=@page.collection.title%>: <%=@page.work.title%> at the URL: <%= collection_transcribe_page_path(@page.collection.owner, @page.collection, @page.work, @page, only_path: false)%>.

Thanks, 
FromThePage
