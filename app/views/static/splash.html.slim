      h2.advantages_title Accessible Anywhere
      p.advantages_text Because FromThePage runs in your browser, you can read and transcribe materials from anywhere &mdash; including tablets and smart phones. This open access extends your reach worldwide &mdash; from the senior citizen a mile away or to a kid in Africa on a phone. (Don't worry &mdash; we have privacy settings for classrooms and smaller workgroups, too.)

      h2.advantages_title It's Fast and Easy
      p.advantages_text You can start projects by uploading PDFs, taking pictures from your camera phone, or importing directly from several digital library systems. Transcribers can start work as soon as material is available and researchers will see their work as soon as each page is saved. You can export at any time, in a variety of formats.
    li.justified_box
      h2.advantages_title Deep Engagement
      p.advantages_text Since transcription is highly immersive, transcribers engage deeply with your texts &mdash; getting to know the time, the people, the places, and the handwriting. Subject linking and articles let readers and transcribers explore the text. In notes on each page, transcribers can ask each other questions about unclear handwriting, identifications of people and places mentioned or discuss events mentioned in the text.
