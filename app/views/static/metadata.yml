transcription_conventions: "<p><b>Transcription Conventions for 1918</b>\r\n<ul><li><i>Spelling:</i>Use
  original spelling if possible.</li>\r\n<li><i>Capitalization:</i>Modernize for readability</li>\r\n<li><i>Punctuation:</i>Add
  modern periods, but don't add punctuation like commas and apostrophes.</li>\r\n<li><i>Line
  Breaks:</i>Hit <code>return</code> once after each line ends.  Two returns indicate
  a new paragraph, which is usually indentation  following the preceding sentence
  in the original.  The times at the end of each entry should get their own paragraph,
  since the software does not support indentation in the transcriptions.</li>\r\n<li><i>Illegible
  text</i>Indicate illegible readings in single square brackets: <code>[Dr?]</code></li>\r\n</ul></p>"
