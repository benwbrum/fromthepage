== Installation

script/install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rf-comments/trunk/restful_comments
script/generate plugin_migration

== Using

Common configuring:
1. Add *map*.*from_plugin* :*restful_comments* to your *routes*.*rb*
2. Copy localization files from {*RAILS_ROOT*}/*vendor*/*plugins*/*restful_comments*/*lang*/*ui* directory to your {*RAILS_ROOT*}/*lang*/*ui* directory, or add their content to your existing localization files
3. In *environment*.*rb* set your localization language (for example, *Globalite*.*language* = :*en*)
4. If you want to specify per-user access rules and your helpers haven't method *current_user*, implement this method in *ApplicationHelper*.

For commentable:
1. Add *acts_as_restful_commentable* into your model class to declare it as commentable
2. Add <%= *restful_comments_include*%> into your erb template to include styles and javascripts
3. Don't forget to add <%= *javascript_include_tag* :*defaults* %> to your layout
4. Add <%= *restful_comments_for* {model_instance} %> into view to render comments of  {model_instance}

== Configuring access

You can specify access rules for different commentable models. To do it, you need to specify block in acts_as_restful_commentable call.

This block can contain some of methods:

	def can_comment?( commentable, comment, user )
	
	def can_edit?( commentable, comment, user )
	
	def can_remove?( commentable, comment, user )

Each method returns if user can make coresponding action on comment. If user comments a commentable, it will be checked with method can_comment?( commentable, nil, user ), if user replyes on specific comment, it will be checked with can_comment?( commentable, comment, user )

If you want to specify user-dependent access, when user must be accessible through current_user method in helper

== Configuring styles

To configure display of editor you may pass hash of options to *restful_citations_include*. Available options:
* :*style* - name of built-in style. Available value: 'gray', 'lj'
* :*stylesheet* - name of application stylesheet to use
